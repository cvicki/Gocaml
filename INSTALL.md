# Installation

There are many ways to set up a working environment to run this project. As of right now, we only need one additional package, Graphics. 

If you don't have brew, install it from here: https://brew.sh

Next, install XQuartz and then restart your computer:

`brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz`

Using the original cs3110-2020fa opam switch, run:

`opam install graphics`

`opam user-setup install`

Once this is complete, run `make clean` and then `make build`. Note, if you're on Windows, we are not sure how the install works, as this has only been tested on Macs.

To actually interact with our program, we have provided a Makefile:
- `make build`: compiles all the necessary files
- `make clean`: deletes files generated by `make build`
- `make test`: runs our oUnit testing suite
- `make zip`: creates a zip file with the important files
- `make gocaml`: launches the game on the GUI on terminal (depends on `TERMINAL` in the Makefile)

These last two are the most important for interacting with GOcaml.
